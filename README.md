# Synchronisation in Chaotic Systems
This repository contains (or rather will contain) the code for my ongoing undergraduate research project on chaotic nonlinear systems at IIT-Delhi. Currently, the repo includes some paper results I tried to replicate and go deeper into to familiarise myself with methods and tools to analyse chaos at the beginning of the project.
